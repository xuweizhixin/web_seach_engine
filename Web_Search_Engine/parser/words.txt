the P
goal P
of P
our P
group P
is P
to P
design P
new P
tools P
and P
techniques P
for P
searching P

analyzing P
the P

our P
work P
is P
focused P
on P
the P
following P
four P
main P
areas P
performance B

current P

we P
are P
working P
to P
improve P
the P
performance P
and P
scalability P
of P
such P
engines P
and P
to P
increase P
the P
quality P

techniques P
for P

are P
looking P
at P
ways P
to P
improve P
basic P

are P
also P
working P
